# The Trattoria
The Trattoria is an Italian restaurant front-end design web app made with react-redux. It contains different features such as the management of dishes in a menu through the collection of state information that is subsequently displayed in other parts of the app. Also, it contains the possibility to retrieve menu information from a pre-built API (not available directly in GitHub).
